# Md Masud Mia - Professional Portfolio Website

## Overview

A sleek, responsive portfolio website I built for **Md Masud Mia**, Materials Engineer specializing in nanotechnology and energy infrastructure. Crafted from his CV, it features interactive sections highlighting his BUET BSc (CGPA 3.05/4.0), research at Titas Gas PLC, DFT thesis on Mo-doped ZnO, publications, and awards. Designed for academicsâ€”bold key points, text-wrapping images, mobile-optimized for iPhone/Samsung.

As a CS Master's applicant, this project showcases my skills in HTML/CSS (float layouts, hovers, grids) to create engaging tech-engineering hybrids. View source for clean, dependency-free code.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Cards**: Education/certificates with image-text wrap; fits Galaxy A51/A71 screens.
- **Animations**: Hover lifts/shadows on research cards.
- **Sections**: Research Experience, Interests (2D materials/DFT), Publications, Extracurriculars (Alokbortika exec, cricket champ), Skills (AutoCAD/VASP).
- **Tech**: Pure HTML/CSS; semantic, accessible.
