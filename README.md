#About the Project
As a full-stack developer aspiring for a Master's in Computer Science, I built this responsive portfolio for Md Masud Mia, a Materials Engineer (BSc BUET, CGPA 3.05/4.0). It highlights his research in DFT simulations, 2D materials, and pipeline integrity at Titas Gas PLCâ€”using custom CSS for text-wrapping images, hover animations, and mobile optimization (e.g., iPhone/Samsung A51 views).
This project showcases my skills in HTML/CSS, responsive design, and user-centric engineering portfolios, bridging tech and academia to impress professors.

##Key Highlights
Research: DFT+U thesis on Mo-doped ZnO for optoelectronics; failure analysis at Titas Gas.
Skills: AutoCAD, SOLIDWORKS, Quantum ESPRESSO/VASP.
Publications: 5+ books on HSC Chemistry/Physics (Rhombus Pubs).
Achievements: Mentored 300+ students; sports champions (Cricket/Badminton).

##Features: Grid layouts, bold key points, certificate viewers.

##Tech Stack
HTML5/CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid + Floats for wrapping)
Vanilla JS (for interactions)
Deployment: Netlify/GitHub
